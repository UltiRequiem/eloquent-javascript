# Eloquent JavaScript

All the code here uses Deno, instead of Node.js.

My internet just gone and I just found I had Eloquent JavaScript downloaded sooo

I will update the test to use std/testing.ts as soon my internet is back.

## Test Driven Development

I hate test driven development.

> Not really, is cool sometimes.

The book doesn't talk about testing (Or I don't get to that part yet) but I
implemented tests for every challenge and followed the TDD method.

> Write tests first, and write code that passes them.
